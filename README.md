#INTRO

I ran my model over multiple sessions, doing 5 epochs a session, so some of the code in mc.py is for setting up the model, and the other is for opening the model and continuing. 
I'm not actually sure how many epochs I ran for my final submission. I think it was 25 or 30, but I'm not sure. I was still getting better and better results, so I suspect that it could continue running with better
and better results for some time before overfitting becomes a problem.

#The test.py is for getting the predicted results and Untitled-2.py is for putting them in the proper order. submit2.csv will be the final result.
